> later; see [Not there yet](#not-there-yet).

## Why

Apple Notes is a pleasure to write in, but it keeps your notes in its own database. Markdown apps keep them as files,
but most of them feel like a code editor or ask you to move everything into a vault. Notebook does both: it shows the
folders you already have, iCloud Drive first, and turns the Markdown files in them into notes that write like Notes.
Pictures, PDFs and every other file sit right next to them and open in the window: PDFs and pictures as in Preview,
videos as in QuickTime Player, the rest in Quick Look. What Notebook saves is ordinary Markdown that GitHub, Obsidian or
iA Writer read just the same, and with iCloud Drive the same notes are on your Mac, iPhone and iPad.

## A quick tour

### Markdown that gets out of the way

You write Markdown, and Notebook shows the result as you type. The marks show faintly next to the caret, only for the
bit you're on, and fold away when you move on. Headings hide their `#` once you type the space after them; while the caret is on
one, its level sits in the margin, and a click there turns it into a title, heading, subheading or body text. Lists continue on Return,
Tab nests them, and checkboxes tick with a click.

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="Design/screenshots/typing-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Typing at the end of a note: two hash marks become the heading Sunday, a checklist item appears, and the stars around lake and the equals signs around coffee show while the caret is next to them, then fold away into bold and a highlight" src="Design/screenshots/typing-light.webp">
</picture>

Nothing moves while you select text or hold the mouse button, so a selection never jumps. Long notes type and scroll
without a stutter.

### Pictures, links and files are objects

Pictures, `[[links]]` to other notes and files you drop in behave as in Notes: the caret steps over them, Backspace
removes one whole, and their Markdown never shows. Type `[[` for suggestions; a link to a note that doesn't exist yet
is drawn dashed and creates the note with a click. Web links show their text with a small pencil that edits the
address. A PDF or any other file on a line of its own becomes a card with a preview, and Space opens it in Quick Look.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="Design/screenshots/objects-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Further down the Kyoto note: a plan with a dashed link to the note Nara that doesn't exist yet, a web link with its pencil, a highlight, a Good to know callout, a table of days and areas, and a card for Flight tickets.pdf" src="Design/screenshots/objects-light.webp">
</picture>

Paste or drop a picture and it's saved next to the note, in a hidden `.assets` folder, as PNG or JPEG so that other
apps can show it. Delete it from the note and the file goes to the Trash once you leave the note, unless another note
in the folder still uses it. Move a note to another folder and its pictures move along.

### Drawings

Click the pencil in the toolbar and draw right in the note, as in Notes. A new drawing goes in below the line you're
on (at the end of the note if you aren't writing), as wide as the text, and grows as you draw near its lower edge, so
you can keep going down. Text stays text: you draw in the drawings, never over the words. On iPhone and iPad it is
PencilKit with Apple's own tool picker, so Apple Pencil with its pressure and tilt, the ruler and the lasso work as
they do in Notes; one finger draws and two scroll, or, where only Apple Pencil draws, a finger scrolls. On the Mac
you draw with the mouse, the trackpad or a tablet's pen, with a pen, pencil, marker or eraser from a palette at the
bottom of the note. Done, Escape or a click in the text puts the drawing back in the text, as tall as what you drew;
start typing and the text goes on below it. Tap a drawing (double-click it on the Mac) to draw in it again.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="Design/screenshots/drawing-dark.webp">
  <img alt="The note Getting to the ryokan open for drawing: a sketch of the way from the station over the river to the ryokan, ringed in red, inside the drawing's frame, and the palette with pen, pencil, marker, eraser, width, colours and Done at the bottom" src="Design/screenshots/drawing-light.webp">
</picture>

Each drawing is a PNG in `.assets`, which every Markdown app shows, with white behind the ink so it reads in dark
mode too. Next to it, a `.drawing` file keeps the strokes, so you can go on drawing in it later, on any of your
devices; the picture is made again from them a moment after every stroke.

### Tables, diagrams, code and maths

Tables are drawn as tables, Mermaid diagrams as diagrams (natively, without a web view), code with highlighting for
about forty languages, and LaTeX maths as typeset formulas. Click into one and its source appears, with a live
preview for diagrams and formulas. Point at a code block and a button in its corner copies the code. Callouts in
GitHub's and Obsidian's `> [!note]` style get their colour and symbol.

</picture>

### Find anything with ⌘F

The search field in the toolbar finds notes and files by name, and words inside notes and PDFs, with the page they're
on. Return opens the first match, and the last suggestion is always a new note with what you typed as its name.
With an empty field, it lists what you opened last.

</picture>

### PDFs, pictures and every other file

Notebook is a browser for your folders, not only for notes. A PDF opens right in the window the way Preview shows it, its
pages one under the other: there at once, and back where you left it when you return. A picture fits the window on the
same grey, never larger than it is; pinch or double-click to zoom in on a spot. A video plays with the system's
controls, as in QuickTime Player. A spreadsheet or any other file opens in Quick Look. The inspector shows a file's
details, and "Open in" hands it to its own app.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="Design/screenshots/quicklook-dark.webp">
  <img alt="Flight tickets.pdf open in the window, its page on grey as in Preview, with its kind, size, page count, dates and folder in the inspector" src="Design/screenshots/quicklook-light.webp">
</picture>

### A Mac app, made of the Mac's parts

The window is built from the system's own pieces: a source-list sidebar, a toolbar with the system's search field and
share menu, an inspector, Settings, alerts, PDFKit, AVKit and Quick Look. It follows the system's light or dark
appearance. The inspector shows a note's outline, with the section you're reading marked and a word count; a click on
a heading scrolls there. In Settings › Text you pick the typeface (San Francisco, New York, Rounded or Monospaced),
the size, the line spacing and the line width. The icon is a leather notebook, and Settings › App Icon makes it yours:
pick the leather, the elastic band, the ribbon and the background, and the Dock shows your notebook while the app is
open. Links, the caret and folders are in ink blue to go with it, or in the accent colour you chose in System Settings.

### On iPhone and iPad

The same notes in the same editor, laid out the way each device works. On the iPhone you go into one folder per screen,
as in the Files app, and a note opens on a screen of its own; swipe from the edge to go back. The first screen has your
favourites, what you opened last and the folders of each location. Search and a new note sit at the bottom, as in Notes,
and search finds names, notes and PDFs as on the Mac. While you write, a bar floats above the keyboard with Aa, a
checklist, attachments, a link, undo and the formatting, a page of tools at a time; Settings › Writing Bar chooses which
and in what order. Aa brings up the Format panel in the keyboard's place, as in Notes: the text styles, bold, italic and
the rest, lists, indenting and quotes. Pictures come from the camera, the document scanner, your photos or the Files
app. The pencil, at the bottom of the screen or in the bar, draws in the note with Apple's tool picker. Tap a checkbox
to tick it, a link to follow it, a picture to look at it, a drawing to draw in it; touch and hold a picture and drag it
to move it in the note, or let go to copy, share or delete it. Swipe a file to move or delete it, or to make it a
favourite; touch and hold it for everything else.

The iPad has the Mac's layout: the sidebar with its folders opening in place, the note next to it, and the outline in
an inspector. In portrait the sidebar steps aside once you have picked a note. With a keyboard, the Mac's shortcuts
work and the menu bar has New Note, Go and Format. Drag pictures from Photos into a note, or files onto a folder in
the sidebar. A window as narrow as a phone gets the iPhone's screens.

## What it does

- **Notes are files.** The title is the file name: rename a note by editing its title, and links to it in other notes
  follow. New notes go into the folder you're in.
- **Folders as they are.** Add iCloud Drive or any folder as a location in the sidebar, with ⌘O or File › Add
  Location. iCloud Drive shows what the Finder shows in it: Desktop and Documents when they are kept in iCloud, and the
  folders of apps such as Pages or Obsidian. Create, rename, duplicate and move notes and folders, by drag and drop or
  with Move To; Option-drag copies. Deleting moves to the Trash, never further. Favourites sit at the top of the
  sidebar.
- **iPhone and iPad.** The same editor, search and file handling, with screens made for each: one folder per screen
  on the iPhone, the sidebar on the iPad. Pick iCloud Drive or any folder in the Files app's picker, or keep notes on
  the device, in On My iPhone › Notebook. A bar above the keyboard, whose tools you choose, formats, links and adds
  photos, scans and files; Aa opens the Format panel as in Notes.
  Deleting moves to Recently Deleted; where a place has none, Notebook asks before it deletes.
- **Hidden folders.** Right-click a folder you don't want to see, such as one another app keeps in iCloud Drive, and
  choose Hide Folder. It leaves the sidebar, search and Move To, and stays hidden on your other Macs through iCloud.
  The eye next to the location's name, or ⇧⌘., shows hidden folders again, dimmed, until you click it again.
- **Live preview editor.** Headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, `==highlight==`, inline code, links, checklists,
  bulleted and numbered lists, quotes, callouts, tables, code blocks, maths, Mermaid, footnotes and front matter, which
  folds into a small "properties" pill.
- **Pictures and files in notes.** Paste or drop them in; `![[embeds]]` of other notes show an excerpt, of files a
  card with a preview.
- **Drawings in notes,** with PencilKit: Apple Pencil, a finger, the mouse, the trackpad or a tablet. Each is a PNG
  that other apps show, with its strokes kept next to it so it stays a drawing in Notebook.
- **PDFs, pictures, videos and other files** open in the window: PDFs and pictures as in Preview, videos as in
  QuickTime Player, the rest in Quick Look.
- **Search** across file names, note text and PDF text.
- **Saves as you type,** and never overwrites a change made somewhere else (see below).
- **Export** a note as a PDF or a PNG image, or print it (on iPhone and iPad: as a PDF to share, or print).
- **Single files.** Open any Markdown file from the Finder or with ⌘O, and it gets a plain window of its own.

## How notes are stored

Everything is plain Markdown, so other apps keep reading your notes. Notebook adds no files of its own besides the
`.assets` folders for pictures and files you add to notes, and in them, next to each drawing's picture, a `.drawing`
file with its strokes.

| What | In the file | In Notebook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title | The file name, `Weekend.md` | A large title above the text; editing it renames the file |
| Picture | `![](.assets/Weekend%202026-10-14%20at%2015.32.10.png)` | The picture, fitted to the width |
| Drawing | `![Drawing](.assets/Weekend%20drawing%202026-10-16%20at%2010.20.15.png)`, with `Weekend drawing 2026-10-16 at 10.20.15.drawing` next to the picture | The drawing, as wide as the text, to draw in again |
| Link to a note or file | `[[Recipes]]`, `[[Recipes\|text]]`, `[[Offer.pdf]]` | A link you click; dashed when the target doesn't exist yet |
| Embed | `![[Recipes]]`, `![[Offer.pdf]]` | An excerpt of the note, or a card for the file |
| Web link | `[text](https://…)` | The text, with a pencil to edit the address |
| Checklist | `- [ ]`, `- [x]` | A round checkbox, filled when done; done items turn grey |
| Highlight | `==text==` | A yellow highlight |
| Callout | `> [!tip] Title` | A coloured box with a symbol |
| Maths | `$x^2$`, `$$ … $$` | A typeset formula |
| Diagram | ```` ```mermaid ```` | The diagram |
| Front matter | `---` YAML `---` at the start | A small pill; click to see the YAML |

`[[Name]]` finds the note by its name, ignoring case and accents: one in the same folder first, then the one with the
shortest path. `[[Folder/Name]]` says exactly which. Remote pictures (`![](https://…)`) are not downloaded; Notebook
shows their address instead.

## When a note changes somewhere else

Notes are often open on more than one Mac, or in more than one app. Notebook watches the open note and the folders in the
sidebar. If a note changes elsewhere while you haven't typed, it reloads quietly, and your caret and scroll position
stay where they were. If both sides changed, Notebook merges the two line by line, before every save as well, so it never
writes over a change it hasn't seen. Only when both changed the same lines does it ask: keep this version, use the
other one, or keep both as two files. Conflicts that iCloud Drive reports are handled the same way.

Notes in iCloud Drive that aren't downloaded yet are fetched so that search finds them; other files that live only in
iCloud show a cloud in the sidebar and download when you open them.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- A Mac with Apple silicon and macOS 27 or later
- An iPhone or iPad with iOS or iPadOS 27 or later, or the Simulator
- Xcode 27 or later, to build it

### Build and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukaskaibel/notebook.git
```

```bash
open notebook/Notebook.xcodeproj
```

Choose the **Notebook** scheme, then **My Mac** or an iPhone or iPad simulator as the destination, and press ⌘R. A local
build needs no Apple developer account: without a team, Xcode signs it to run on your Mac and in the Simulator. To run
it on your own iPhone or iPad, or to sign with your own team, create `Config/Local.xcconfig` with `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM =
<your team ID>`; it isn't checked in. A local build keeps hidden folders on the device; only the App Store build, signed
with a team, has the iCloud entitlement that takes them to your other devices.

### Adding your notes

On first launch, Notebook asks for a folder: **Open iCloud Drive**, or **Choose another folder…**. Add more later with
File › Open… (⌘O), File › Add Location…, Settings › General, or by dropping a folder on Notebook in the Dock. Notebook works
on the files in place; nothing is copied or imported.

On iPhone and iPad, **Choose a Folder** opens the Files app's picker: pick iCloud Drive itself to have everything you
write on the Mac, or any folder in it or on the device. **Keep Notes on This iPhone** (or iPad) uses Notebook's own
folder, which the Files app shows under On My iPhone › Notebook. Add more in Settings, from the ⋯ menu.

To look around without your own notes, run a Debug build with the arguments `-NotebookLibrary /tmp/NotebookSample
-NotebookDemo YES` (Product › Scheme › Edit Scheme › Arguments). It writes a few sample notes, pictures and PDFs to that
folder and shows only them, for that run. In the Simulator, use `-NotebookLibrary ~/Documents/Sample`, which is in the
app's own folder there.

## Using it

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ⌘N | New note in the current folder |
| ⇧⌘N | New folder |
| ⌘F | Search |
| ⌘[ and ⌘], or swipe between pages | Back and forward; the swipe follows System Settings, as in Safari |
| ⌘O | Open a Markdown file in a window of its own, or a folder in the sidebar |
| ⌃⌘S | Show or hide the sidebar |
| ⌃⌘I | Show or hide the outline |
| ⇧⌘. | Show or hide hidden folders |
| ⌘+, ⌘− and ⌘0 | Bigger, smaller and actual text size |
| ⌥⌘E | Export as PDF |
| ⌘P | Print |
| ⌘, | Settings |

While writing:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ⌘B, ⌘I | Bold, italic |
| ⇧⌘X | Strikethrough |
| ⌃⌘H | Highlight |
| ⌘E | Inline code |
| ⌘L | Link: wraps the selection, or starts a `[[link]]` |
| ⇧⌘T, ⇧⌘H, ⇧⌘J, ⇧⌘B | Title, heading, subheading, body |
| ⇧⌘L | Checklist |
| ⇧⌘U | Mark as checked |
| ⇧⌘7, ⇧⌘9 | Bulleted list, numbered list |
| ⌘' | Block quote |
| Tab, ⇧Tab | Nest or un-nest a list item (in code: indent) |
| ⌥⌘] and ⌥⌘[ | Increase and decrease indent |
| `*`, `_`, `` ` ``, `~` or `=` with text selected | Wrap the selection in that mark |
| `[[` | Suggestions for a link; ↑↓ and Return or Tab to pick |
| Space on a selected picture | Quick Look |
| Double-click a drawing | Draw in it |
| Esc, or start typing | Stop drawing; typing goes on below the drawing |
| ↑ on the first line | Into the title; Return, Tab or ↓ back into the text |

In the sidebar: Return renames, ⌘⌫ moves to the Trash, and Space opens a file in Quick Look. Right-click a file or
folder for everything else, including Copy Link, which copies a `[[link]]` to it, and Hide Folder. When a location has
hidden folders, an eye comes up next to its name as you point at it.

On an iPad with a keyboard, ⌘N, ⌘F, ⌘[ and ⌘], ⌃⌘I and the shortcuts for writing work as on the Mac. On iPhone
and iPad:

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Swipe from the left edge | Back to the folder or the note you came from (iPhone) |
| Swipe a file to the left or right | Move or delete it, or add it to your favourites |
| Touch and hold a file or folder | Rename, move, duplicate, copy a link, share and more |
| Pull a list down | Read the folder again |
| Tap a checkbox, a link or a picture | Tick it, follow it, or look at it in Quick Look |
| Tap a drawing | Draw in it |
| While drawing: one finger, two fingers | Draw, scroll (where only Apple Pencil draws, a finger scrolls) |
| Touch and hold a picture or file in a note, then drag | Move it to another place in the note, or into another app |
| Touch and hold a picture or file, then let go | Select it: Quick Look, copy, cut, share or delete |
| Tap the heading level in the margin | Title, heading, subheading or body (iPad) |
| Drag down over a note | Put the keyboard away |

## Not there yet

Planned, and not built yet:

- **Quick capture:** a widget, a control in Control Center and on the Lock Screen, the Action button and a share
  extension, all adding a note to an Inbox folder.
- **Spotlight,** text recognition in pictures and scans, and a search index that's kept between launches; today it is
  rebuilt at every launch.
- Links follow a renamed note, but not yet a moved one, a renamed folder or a rename in a single-file window.
  Footnotes are styled but don't jump to their text.
- On iPhone and iPad there is no Settings › App Icon (iOS only switches between icons built into the app), no PNG
  export and no window of its own for a single file.
- **Sketches** as files of their own, next to your notes rather than in one, and search in handwriting.
- Translations: the app is in English only.

The full plan, with what is deliberately left out (tags, backlinks, a database, sync of its own), is in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md), in German.

```

The editor is the heart of the app. The text view holds the file's Markdown exactly, character for character, and
everything you see is styling on top: marks are hidden as zero-width glyphs and objects are drawn in place of a
character, so undo, dictation and spell checking behave as everywhere else on the Mac. Start reading at
`Editor/EditorController.swift` and `Editor/NotebookLayoutManager.swift`. On iPhone and iPad the same storage, layout
manager and styling sit under UIKit's text view; only what talks to the text view differs (`Editor/*+AppKit.swift`
and `Editor/*+UIKit.swift`), plus an undo history of the editor's own, since UIKit's goes wrong when the editor
changes the text itself.

Run the tests (they use off-screen windows and temporary folders, and touch none of your files):

```bash
cd Packages/NotebookKit && swift test
```

The pictures in this README are made by a script. It builds the app, runs it in the background on the sample notes,
takes the scenes in light and dark, and lays them out together with `Design/social-preview.png`. The iPhone and iPad
pictures come from two simulators of its own, without the Simulator app's window. It doesn't take over your Mac (only
the search suggestions show on screen for a moment) and leaves your own Notebook's settings alone. Run it again when a
change shows in one of them (`devices` takes only the iPhone and iPad picture, which works with the screen asleep):

```bash
Tools/readme-images.sh
```

The app icon is drawn by `Tools/AppIcon/notebook.py`. After changing it, run the script below: it writes
`Notebook/AppIcon.icon` and renders, with Icon Composer's `ictool`, the grey passes that Settings › App Icon colours in
any leather (it needs Python 3 with NumPy and Pillow, and `brew install librsvg`):

```bash
Tools/AppIcon/make.sh
```

Debug builds can be driven from a file: launch with `-debugCommandFile <path>` and append commands such as
`open Travel/Kyoto trip.md`, `type Hello`, `key return` or `snapshot <file>` to it, one per line. The commands are
listed in `Debug/DebugRemote.swift`, and for iPhone and iPad in `Debug/DebugRemote+UIKit.swift`; in the Simulator the
file is in the app's own folder (`-debugCommandFile ~/Documents/cmd`), where `xcrun simctl get_app_container` finds it,
and `xcrun simctl io <device> screenshot` takes the pictures.
