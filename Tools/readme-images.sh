# The Mac app runs in the background on a fresh copy of the sample notes (Debug/DemoLibrary.swift), under a bundle
# identifier of its own so your Notebook's settings stay as they are. It never comes to the front and leaves keyboard and
# mouse alone; only the search suggestions show on screen for a moment. The iPhone and iPad pictures come from two
# simulators of the script's own ("Notebook README iPhone" and "… iPad"), which run without the Simulator app's window.
# Takes about three minutes. Needs Screen Recording permission for the terminal, a Retina display, Python 3 with
# Pillow and NumPy, ffmpeg and img2webp (brew install ffmpeg webp), and the iOS Simulator runtime of Xcode.
