# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help. This is a small project with one maintainer, so a little coordination up front saves
everyone time.

## Before you start

- **Bugs:** open an issue with what you did, what you expected and what happened. Screenshots or a short recording
  help a lot for anything visual, and so does the Markdown of the note, if you can share it.
- **Features and larger changes:** open an issue first and describe the idea. Notebook is deliberately small: every
  feature has to answer "do I need this to replace Apple Notes day to day?", and [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) lists what is left
  out on purpose. It is better to find out whether something fits before you write the code.
- **Small fixes** (typos, obvious bugs): a pull request without an issue is fine.

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Build and run from Xcode (see the README). Try your change on the sample notes (`-NotebookLibrary <folder>
   -NotebookDemo YES`) rather than your own.
3. Run the tests: `cd Packages/NotebookKit && swift test`.
4. Open a pull request against `main` and describe what changed and how you checked it.

Every pull request is reviewed and merged by the maintainer; nothing lands on `main` without that approval.

## What to keep in mind

- **The file is the truth.** The editor holds the file's Markdown character for character, and what Notebook saves is
  Markdown any other app reads the same. Don't add a database, a sidecar file or syntax only Notebook understands.
- **Never lose a change.** Saving goes through `NSFileCoordinator` and merges with what is on disk
  (`Files/NoteDocument.swift`, `Files/Diff3.swift`). Anything that writes files keeps that promise, and deleting means
  the Trash.
- **Nothing jumps.** Text never moves under a selection or the mouse, and scrolling never jumps. If you touch the
  editor's styling or layout, type in a long note and scroll it before and after; `EditorSmoothnessTests` has to pass.
- **Nothing waits.** The window never stops for the disk or for iCloud: folders, bookmarks and the search index are
  read off the main thread (`Files/FolderReader.swift`, `Files/LocationSurvey.swift`, `Index/SearchIndex.swift`), and
  what the main thread does with the result is only the part that changed. Changes to files (a new note, a rename, a
  move, the Trash) are written off the main thread too, one after another (`Workspace.changeFiles`), and show in the
  sidebar as soon as they are done, before their folder has been read again. A note or other file still in iCloud
  opens at once and fills in when it has come down (`Files/NoteDocument.swift`, `UI/FileLoadingView.swift`). Try a
  change with `-NotebookSlowFolders 2`, `-NotebookSlowFiles 2` and `-NotebookSlowWrites 2`. Nothing that happens as a note opens or as you type goes
  through every file or folder either: a whole iCloud Drive has a hundred thousand. Look things up by name
  (`SearchIndex.resolve`), keep sorted lists ready, and make long menus when they open (`UI/MoveToSubmenu.swift`).
- **Markdown is a file format, not the interface.** Pictures, links and embeds are objects; marks show only next to
  the caret.
- **Use what the Mac has.** System components and layout (split view, source list, inspector, toolbar, search field,
  alerts, Quick Look) rather than custom chrome, and system colours rather than new ones.
- **Show what changed.** A change people will notice gets a line in `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased", and the README
  follows: the tour, "What it does", the shortcut tables, "Not there yet", and the pictures (`Tools/readme-images.sh`).
  A feature worth a picture gets something in the sample notes (`Debug/DemoLibrary.swift`) to show it with.
- Match the style of the code around you. Comments explain why, not what.

## Releases

Versions follow semantic versioning. The version lives in `Config/Shared.xcconfig`; each release gets an entry in
`CHANGELOG.md` and a tag of the form `v0.1.0`.
